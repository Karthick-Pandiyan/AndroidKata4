Berlin Clock Kata

The Berlin Clock (Mengenlehreclock or Berlin Uhr) is a clock that tells the time
using a series of illuminated coloured blocks, as you can see in the picture for this project.

The top lamp blinks to show seconds- it is illuminated on even seconds and off on odd seconds.

The next two rows represent hours. The upper row represents 5 hour blocks and is made up of 4 red lamps.
The lower row represents 1 hour blocks and is also made up of 4 red lamps.

The final two rows represent the minutes. The upper row represents 5 minute blocks,
and is made up of 11 lamps- every third lamp is red, the rest are yellow.
The bottom row represents 1 minute blocks, and is made up of 4 yellow lamps.

Feature 1 -  Converting Digital Time to Berlin Time

---------------------------------------------------------
Implement the Single Minutes Row:
    As a clock user
    I want to be able to see single minutes
    So that I can accurately tell the time down to the minute

    Given I have started the converter
    When I enter $time
    Then $row is returned for the single minutes row

----------------------------------------------------------
Implement the Five Minutes Row
    As a clock user
    I want to be able to see five minutes
    So that I can tell higher minute amounts more easily at a glance

    Given I have started the converter
    When I enter $time
    Then $row is returned for the five minutes row

----------------------------------------------------------
Implement the Single Hours Row
    As a clock user
    I want to be able to see single hours
    So that I can tell what hour it is

    Given I have started the converter
    When I enter $time
    Then $row is returned for the single hours row

----------------------------------------------------------
Implement the Five Hours Row
    As a clock user
    I want to be able to see five hours
    So that I can tell higher hour amounts more easily at a glance

    Given I have started the converter
    When I enter $time
    Then $row is returned for the five hours row

----------------------------------------------------------
Implement the Seconds Lamp
    As a clock user
    I want to be able to see seconds passing
    So that I can see if my clock is working at a glance

    Given I have started the converter
    When I enter $time
    Then $lamp is returned for the seconds lamp
----------------------------------------------------------
Integrate the Entire Berlin Clock
    As a clock user
    I want to be able to see an entire clock
    So that I can tell what time it is at a glance

    Given I have started the converter
    When I enter $time
    Then $clock is returned
